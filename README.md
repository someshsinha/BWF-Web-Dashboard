# BWF Web Dashboard

Web-based Admin and Warden dashboard for the [Borderless World Foundation](https://www.borderlessworldfoundation.org/) Management System.

This application provides centralized control for managing students, wardens, expenses, activity tracking, analytics, and moderated community content.

Built using Next.js for performance, scalability, and server-side rendering capabilities.

## Installation

```
npm install

```

For production build:

```
npm run build
npm start
```

## Integration

This dashboard depends on:

* `bwf-backend` for API services
* JWT token-based authentication
* Role-based route guards

Ensure the backend is running before starting the dashboard.

## Security Considerations

* Protect admin routes using middleware
* Store tokens securely
* Validate all role permissions server-side
* Never trust client-side role checks alone
